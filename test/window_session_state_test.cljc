  "Test suite for the restored `window-session-state` (kami-os) namespaces.

  The original Rust crate (kami-engine/kami-os, deleted in
  kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82) had zero `#[test]` functions in any of
  its 9 source files (verified by grepping the pre-deletion tree at
  a8368f9c0d784dbc9d11e8fa8f407aa95c7ce4fa) — so there is nothing to
  port 1:1. Instead this suite provides original coverage of every
  ported pure function across all modules, plus the pre-existing
  namespace-loads smoke test."
