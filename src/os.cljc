  "KAMI OS desktop — top-level ECS-world orchestration tying together
  window management, the compositor, input routing, taskbar, launcher,
  and notifications. Restored from the legacy kami-engine/kami-os
  `lib.rs` (deleted in kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82 'Remove Rust
  workspace from kami-engine') as part of the clj-wgsl migration
  (ADR-2607010930, com-junkawasaki/root).

  ## Architecture

  - **ECS (hecs) → plain maps**: the original held Windows,
    Notifications, and TaskbarItems as `hecs::World` entities. There is
    no portable equivalent to a native ECS, so windows are represented
    here as plain integer window IDs used as map keys in a `:windows`
    map on the desktop (same entity-as-plain-ID adaptation used
    successfully in `kotoba-lang/scene-graph` and `kotoba-lang/core`).
  - **Compositor**: z-ordered window state — ported in `os.compositor`.
    Actual wgpu draw calls are GPU rendering and out of scope.
  - **Input router**: focus-aware dispatch state — ported in
    `os.input-router` (mirrors the `[:panel id]`/`[:modal id]`/
    `[:global-overlay]`/`[:none]` resolution pattern already
    established in the sibling `kotoba-lang/input` restoration).
  - **Bridge**: `kami-bridge` (native OS input capture) and `kami-knp`
    (device mesh) are native-substrate dependencies with no portable
    CLJC equivalent — entirely out of scope. Callers on the native
    substrate are expected to translate native input into the abstract
    events this namespace and `os.input-router` consume.

  The original's `GameClock` (fixed 30fps compositor tick) is
  reimplemented locally in `advance` as a simple portable accumulator,
  since `kami-core::time::GameClock` is a separate not-yet-restored
  crate; this preserves the original's fixed-timestep tick-counting
  semantics without pulling in unrelated native timing code.

  Zero-dep portable CLJC — pure data + pure functions, no IO/GPU."
