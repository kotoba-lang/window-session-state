  "Window compositor state — z-order, focus, and drag tracking. Restored
  from the legacy kami-engine/kami-os `compositor.rs` (deleted in
  kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82 'Remove Rust workspace from
  kami-engine') as part of the clj-wgsl migration (ADR-2607010930,
  com-junkawasaki/root).

  The original ran once per frame to sort windows by z-order and drive
  wgpu draw calls (desktop background, per-window shadow/rect/title-bar/
  content, and overlay rendering via kami-ui-gpu + kami-text). All of
  that GPU rendering is intentionally out of scope here (it lives in the
  native substrate, not portable CLJC) — this namespace owns only the
  portable z-stack / focus / drag *state machine* that the renderer
  would consume as its render-order and hit-test input.

  Zero-dep portable CLJC — pure data + pure functions, no IO/GPU.")
