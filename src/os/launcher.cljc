  "App launcher overlay — grid of installed apps. Restored from the
  legacy kami-engine/kami-os `launcher.rs` (deleted in
  kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82 'Remove Rust workspace from
  kami-engine') as part of the clj-wgsl migration (ADR-2607010930,
  com-junkawasaki/root).

  Activated from the taskbar button or a keyboard shortcut (Super key);
  shows a searchable grid of app icons. This namespace ports the search
  filter / keyboard-navigation *state machine*; the actual grid draw
  (icons, layout) is GPU rendering and out of scope.

  Zero-dep portable CLJC — pure data + pure functions, no IO/GPU."
