  "File explorer — directory-listing view state for an R2/IPFS-backed
  file browser. Restored from the legacy kami-engine/kami-os
  `file_explorer.rs` (deleted in kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82 'Remove
  Rust workspace from kami-engine') as part of the clj-wgsl migration
  (ADR-2607010930, com-junkawasaki/root).

  The original fetched directory entries via Magatama XRPC commands
  (`app.etzhayyim.os.sync.*`) against R2/IPFS storage; that network IO
  is out of scope here — this namespace owns only the portable view
  state: current path, navigation (into/up), multi-select, sort order,
  and view mode. Callers are expected to populate `:entries` from their
  own XRPC/network layer after a `navigate`/`navigate-up`.

  Zero-dep portable CLJC — pure data + pure functions, no IO/GPU."
