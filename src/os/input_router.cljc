  "Focus-aware input routing. Restored from the legacy kami-engine/kami-os
  `input_router.rs` (deleted in kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82 'Remove
  Rust workspace from kami-engine') as part of the clj-wgsl migration
  (ADR-2607010930, com-junkawasaki/root).

  The original was a thin OS-specific wrapper over `kami-input`'s
  generic `FocusManager` (panel focus / modal stack / global overlay).
  That generic focus manager was already restored to CLJC in the
  sibling `kotoba-lang/input` repo as `input/focus-manager` et al
  (`[:panel id]` / `[:modal id]` / `[:global-overlay]` / `[:none]`
  resolution). Rather than duplicate it, this namespace reimplements
  the same tiny state machine locally (kept dependency-free per this
  repo's zero-dep-portable-CLJC scope) using the identical shape and
  semantics, plus the OS-specific sentinel (`consent-modal-id`) and
  method names from `input_router.rs`.

  Zero-dep portable CLJC — pure data + pure functions, no IO/GPU.")
